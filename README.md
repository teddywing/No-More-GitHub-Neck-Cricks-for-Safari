No More GitHub Neck Cricks for Safari
=====================================

A Safari browser extension that rotates the [GitHub](https://github.com) Network Graph 90 degrees so that branch names are horizontal and easier to read.


# Installing
The easy and quick way is to double-click the `no-more-github-neck-cricks.safariextz` file and click the “Install” button when prompted. This will add the extension to your list of Safari extensions.

If you want to be able to test and modify the extension, then install it via the Safari Extension Builder. You’ll need a Safari developer certificate (https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/UsingExtensionBuilder/UsingExtensionBuilder.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009977-CH2-SW1).

Ensure that you have the Develop menu enabled. Under the menu, select the “Show Extension Builder” option. Click the “+” button at the bottom-left corner of the Extension Builder window and choose “Add Extension…”. Select the `no-more-github-neck-cricks.safariextension` directory. You will now be able to install the extension by clicking the “Install” button at the top right.


# Help! Mouse-dragging is all weird!
The graph may be rotated, but the controls aren’t. Here’s a handy translation key.

## Mouse dragging
* UP: graph moves RIGHT
* DOWN: graph moves LEFT
* LEFT: graph moves UP
* RIGHT: graph moves DOWN

## Arrow keys (keyboard)
* UP: graph moves LEFT
* DOWN: graph moves RIGHT
* LEFT: graph moves DOWN
* RIGHT: graph moves UP
